            <h1 class="title">Air Fried Meatball</h1>
            <p>After trying air fryer meatballs, I will never bake them in the oven again. The insides stay nice and tender while the outsides get a slight crisp on them. The best part is that you can make them ahead of time and freeze for later use.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <div class="ingredients">
                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>16 ounces lean ground beef </li>
                <li>4 ounces ground pork</li>
                <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
                <li>⅓ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>
</div>
            

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Combine beef, pork, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt in a large bowl. Mix until evenly combined. Form into 16 equal meatballs (a small ice cream scoop is helpful) and place on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Place 1/2 of the meatballs in the basket of the air fryer and cook 8 minutes. Shake the basket and cook 2 minutes more. Transfer to a serving plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining meatballs.</li>
            </ol>
